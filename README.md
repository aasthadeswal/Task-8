#Elevate-Labs-Task-6 (Data Visualization)

📊 Sales Dashboard using Power BI / Tableau

This project is part of Task 6 of my Data Analyst Internship at Elevate Labs. The objective is to visualize sales data using Power BI or Tableau by transforming the order date, applying filters, and identifying key insights using various charts and interactive elements.


🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following columns:

Order_Date – Date of order placed

Region – Region where the sale occurred

Category – Category of the product

Product_Name – Product name

Units_Sold – Quantity sold

Unit_Price – Price per unit

Total_Revenue – Revenue from each order


📌 Steps

1. Import the CSV file into Power BI or Tableau


2. Convert Order_Date to Month-Year format


3. Add 2–3 visuals to the dashboard:

Line Chart: Sales over Months

Bar Chart: Sales by Region

Donut Chart: Sales by Category



4. Add a filter/slicer for Region or Category


5. Use color coding to highlight top-performing areas
